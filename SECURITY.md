## Reporting a Vulnerability

We'd kindly ask you to follow responsible disclosure.
You can report a vulnerability to rugk+security [at] posteo.de.
You can request a PGP key privately in case you need it.
(Please don't use my git signing key or similar, as the key is a different one than the one used for mail encryption.)
